Got in the [atom][atom] beta today, making this post using it.

My first impressions:

1. Fast.
2. Low Memory Footprint.
3. Replaces need for Sublime Text or Text Mate entirely.
4. Clean UI and easy to use.
5. Yet another app on the increasingly popular .io domain.
6. Seems like they created it for training purposes. (Schools etc)
8. Decent set of packages.

Although [Atom][atom] doesn't replace a full featured IDE, it seems
like a great fit for a developers tool box. Something to use when
you don't want to open your bloated IDE.

The most important thing about [Atom][atom] is the direction that
you can now see [Github][github] taking, which is, web based code editing.
I feel for any other start up out there that has already entered
this market or is currently trying because [Github][github] will
win this with easy.

It also highlights the move to the web, which some people keep denying
but in the back of their minds know its the future.

Whats next for [Github][github] after this? I am going to venture to
guess they will move into to the virtual developer box similar to
[nitrous.io][nitrus].  Since your code is already hosted by them, and
now you have an editor, all you need is a place to run the code.
